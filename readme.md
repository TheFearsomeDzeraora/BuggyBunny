# BuggyBunny
Program for unpacking contents of .bzz files found in Bugs Bunny Lost in Time (and maybe some other games)

#### Usecases
* Extract sound, text and image data from within BZZ archives

#### What to edit extracted data with?
* Texts can be edited using your favourite text editor. Just make sure to save it in ASCII. (ms notepad will do fine)
* Images can be altered using Tim2View
* You can listen to audio with any vag compatible program like JPSXDec and PSound, editing IDK

#### Usage:
* This program has a useful feature, so that when you paste a file path into the text box it automagically gets rid of quotes and renames the file correctly, so you can just copy path of the first file and paste it into both boxes without any further edits
1. Extract BZZ archive with toolBZZ by Denim (provided with the app)
2. Input correct file path into the fiels (use the tip mentioned above, it'll save you a lot of time)
3. Click `Unpack` to extract. You'll hear the Windows Exclaimation sound once it finishes
4. Go ahead and edit stuff! Just don't add any more files, edit existing ones
5. Click `Repack` to put it back together. The original files will be automatically renamed and new ones saved in their place
6. Compress back using toolBZZ
7. Put back into game image and test it
8. Rinse and repeat steps 4-7 until you're satisfied (pls, don't rinse your PC nor your PS1, I'm not gonna be responsible for damaged hardware)
9. Profit!?

#### Credits:
* __Denim__ - for writing toolBZZ and allowing it to be distributed with my app
* __rubinho146__ - for getting me involved and walking me through basic stuff like if I were a noob (and I were in PlayStation hacking), doing most of the beta testing and also being an awesome friend XD
* __TheFearsomeDzeraora/CHEMI6DER__ - writing this abomination of a program, crappy code and awful GUI are included as usual
